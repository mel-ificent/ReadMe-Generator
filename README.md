## Description
The purpose of this application is to help developers save time creating README.md files for their various projects and repositories.  The program will take the user through a series of command-line prompts to gather details about the project such as title, description, licensing information, contact information, etc.  With that user’s input, the program writes a high-quality README.md file which then a user can use or build upon further.<br><br>  A few highlights from this project:<br> - Developed using Node.js<br> - Use of NPM Inquirer package to facilitate command-line prompts for user input<br> - File System module for creating README.md file<br> - Use of modules to structure the application code

## Installation
This code requires the following to be installed:<br> - Node.js<br> -  [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)<br><br>  Note: consider creating a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your. .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.


## Usage
To use this application, first run the command ‘node index.js’ to start the prompts.<br><br>  ![Run Application](./assets/images/runApp.jpg) <br><br>  Answer each prompt as completely as possible.<br><br>  ![User Prompts](./assets/images/userInput.jpg) <br> <br>  Once all prompts have been answered, a README.md file will be generated.  You can then make additional updates directly to the file as needed.<br><br> ![Sample ReadMe](./assets/images/sampleReadMe.jpg)<br><br>  Tip: Because this is a command-line prompt, the program will not like explicit ‘keyboard-enters’.  You can get a little fancy by adding Markdown language syntax to add line breaks, images, links, etc as a part of your input for a fuller, more complete README. <br><br>  Remember, this is just a template.  The sky’s the limit here!  Feel free to tweak the code and make it your own to include more sections (e.g. features, badges, etc.) and details as you see fit.
